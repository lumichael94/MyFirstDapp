Serpent contracts with Node Client/Server

MyFirstDapp demonstrates the interaction between a client, server, and contract. Currently it sends requested amounts of ether to a static address.

Feel free to extend it for your own projects, such as:
* Ether Fountains
* Automatic ether forwarding
* Scripting a regular charitable payment
