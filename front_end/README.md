The frontend is run through vagrant to ensure it works on your system. First install <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>.

If you are on a UNIX system run <code>vagrant up</code> from this directory.
After it completes you need to start node inside vagrant
```vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
nodejs app.js```
